    "- Use same datasets as Project 1.\n",
    "- Preprocess data: Explore data and apply data scaling.\n",

    "- Apply any two models with bagging and any two models with pasting.\n",
    "- Apply any two models with adaboost boosting\n",
    "- Apply one model with gradient boosting\n",
    "- Apply PCA on data and then apply all the models in project 1 again on data you get from PCA. Compare your results with results in project 2. You don't need to apply all the models twice. Just copy the result table from project 1, prepare similar table for all the models after PCA and compare both tables. Does PCA help in getting better results?\n",
